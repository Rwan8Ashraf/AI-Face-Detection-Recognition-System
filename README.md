# Project Proposal

## Project Idea
**Description:**  
Our project is an AI-based Face Recognition System using computer vision techniques.  
It detects and recognizes faces in real-time from webcam input. The system can register new faces, capture snapshots, and maintain a database of known faces.   
**Expected outcomes:** A functional desktop application that can recognize multiple faces in real-time, store new faces, and provide a user-friendly interface.

## Objectives
- Develop a real-time face detection and recognition system.  
- Enable registration of new faces and storage of face images.  
- Implement snapshot capturing for logging or record-keeping.  
- Create a clean and interactive user interface using CustomTkinter.  
- Ensure system accuracy and reliability in various lighting and background conditions.

## Scope
**In scope:**  
- Real-time face detection and recognition using DeepFace.  
- Snapshot capture functionality.  
- Registration of new users.  
- Desktop GUI application using CustomTkinter.  

**Out of scope:**  
- Mobile application version.  
- Advanced facial emotion detection or analytics.  
- Integration with external databases or cloud services.
